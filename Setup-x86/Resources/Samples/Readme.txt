Sample Readme...

There is a sample project called "Demoproject" for downloading on the Website http://www.ogama.net.
It is created for you to make easily first experiences with ogama.
Extract it into the OgamaExperiments folder of your "My Documents" folder and start "demoproject.oga".

There is also a new "SlideShowDemo" project available on the website that shows ogamas presentation capabilities.

Have fun. Would love to have some feedback on it.
