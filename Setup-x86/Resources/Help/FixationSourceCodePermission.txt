Hi Adrian,

You are free to use the LC Technologies fixation detection source code as you wish.

As you suggested in your email, we ask only that you reference LC Technologies when you publish any adaptations.

It is wonderful that you have adapted the code to C#.NET.  If you would like to make your version available on the Internet, we'd be happy to create a link to your site from ours.

We appreciate your interest and good work.

Sincerely,

Dixon

Subject: Fixation source code


Dear Mr. Hamilton,

Under which conditions it is possible to use the published fixation detection source code of LC Technologies in an open source gaze and mouse tracking analysis software ? I adopted the code to C#.NET and added a time estimation support.
The open source software is designed to analyze both eye and mouse data in parallel for which we could not find a applicable commercial software solution.
It would be very kind from you to allow us to use and adopt your code and publish it with the software keeping your original copyright. We think it is a good approach to rely on professional and experienced solutions. The software is intended for non-commercial use in academic environments.

Hope for a reply and thanks for publishing the code,
